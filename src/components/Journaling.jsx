        Journaling: Becoming Marcus Aurelius
      </h3>

      <p className={styles.aboutParagraph}>
        Ryan Holiday, a prominent author of stoic philosophy, considers
        journaling a pilar of stoicism. Holiday encourages individuals to engage
        in regular self-reflection, to examine their thoughts and actions, and
        to learn from their experiences.
      </p>

      <p className={styles.aboutParagraph}>
        Journaling, in this context, serves as a way to practice and learn
        stoicism. Holiday claims that philosophy isn't something we read once
        and understand. Rather, it is an active practice and something one does
        with oneself.
