          Stoicism takes the position that the wise, the good man, the
          philosopher is a man who lives in accordance with nature. He fears
          only abdicating his moral responsibility. He is not afraid of pain. He
          is not afraid of death. He is not afraid of poverty. He is not afraid
          of any of the vicissitudes of the Human Condition. He fears only that
          he should let himself down and that he should be less than a complete
          human being.

        <h3 class="more-info-header">Who was Marcus Aurelius?</h3>
        <p class="more-info-content">
          Marcus Aurelius, a Roman emperor and philosopher, became the ruler of
          Rome in 161 AD, serving until his death in 180 AD. Recognized as one
          of the &ldquo;Five Good Emperors,&rdquo; he reigned over the last part
          of the Pax Romana, or Roman Peace. Throughout his rule, Marcus
          Aurelius faced challenges, including military campaigns against
          Germanic tribes and the Parthian Empire. <br /><br />Despite the the
          precedent of decadence and hedonism, he maintained a reputation for
          integrity and self-discipline, embodying Stoic principles in both his
          personal and political life.

          experience and the importance of living in accordance with reason and
          virtue. <br /><br />The philosophical insights presented in
          <cite>Meditations</cite> have transcended time, making the work a
          timeless source of inspiration for individuals seeking wisdom and

        <h3 class="more-info-header">Journaling: Becoming Marcus Aurelius</h3>
        <p class="more-info-content">
          Ryan Holiday, a prominent author of stoic philosophy, considers
          journaling a pilar of stoicism. Holiday encourages individuals to
          engage in regular self-reflection, to examine their thoughts and
          actions, and to learn from their experiences. <br /><br />Journaling,
          in this context, serves as a way to practice and learn stoicism.
          Holiday claims that philosophy isn't something we read once and
          understand. Rather, it is an active practice and something one does
          with oneself.
