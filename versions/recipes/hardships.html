        According to Marcus Aurelius we should not fear external hardships such
        as pain, death, poverty, or the various challenges of the human
        condition. Instead, our primary fear should be abdicating moral
        responsibility and falling short of being a complete human being.

        He acknowledges that negative events and adversities are inevitable in
        life. Marcus advises against futile efforts such as praying for negative
        events not to happen. He suggests accepting that these challenges will
        occur because nothing cane be done to prevent them. The focus, according
        to Marcus, should be on how to react to these events.
      </p>
      <br /><br />
      <p>
        When adversity comes, Marcus Aurelius encourages a Stoic response. He
        advises against complaining and instead advocates for action and
        endurance. He reminds us that individuals can control their reactions to
        events, even if they can't control the events themselves.
