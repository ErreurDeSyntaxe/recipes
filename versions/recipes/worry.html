        Marcus Aurelius advises against worrying about the future. The Stoic
        philosophy suggests that a wise and virtuous person lives in accordance
        with nature and does not fear external events such as pain, death, or
        poverty. He emphasizes the importance of focusing on moral
        responsibility and being a complete human being.

      <br /><br />
      <p>
        Since the the future is beyond one's control worrying about it is
        counterproductive and futile. Stoicism encourages individuals to
        concentrate on what they can control, such as their reactions to events,
        rather than expending energy on anxieties about uncertain future
        outcomes. The emphasis is on accepting the inevitability of certain
        events, including adversity and death, and facing them with courage and
        virtue when they occur.
