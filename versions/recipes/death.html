      <p>
        In <cite>Meditations,</cite> Marcus Aurelius reflects on death as an
        inevitable and natural part of the human experience. He contemplates the
        transient nature of life, emphasizing that death is a universal fate
        that everyone must face. Rather than fearing death, Marcus Aurelius
        encourages a stoic acceptance of its inevitability, viewing it as a
        natural process in the cycle of existence.
      </p>

      <p>
        He underscores the idea that dwelling on the fear of death is
        counterproductive and distracts from living a virtuous and meaningful
        life. Instead, he suggests focusing on the present moment, acting with
        integrity, and fulfilling one's responsibilities. For Marcus Aurelius,
        the acceptance of mortality becomes a catalyst for a life well-lived,
        urging individuals to make the most of their time and contribute
        positively to the world.
