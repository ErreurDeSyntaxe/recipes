        Marcus Aurelius acknowledges the existence of what he refers to as
        "evil" or "bad" people, asserting that they are simply part of the
        universe. He discourages the idea of expecting the world not to present
        these individuals and likens it to asking a vine to exist without
        thorns. The acknowledgement of bad people is woven into his
        understanding of the natural order, and he encourages looking inward
        when dealing with them.
      </p>
      <br /><br />
      <p>
        Marcus believes in kindness and posits that people, when doing wrong,
        are often driven by ignorance rather than a deliberate desire to do
        harm. While he acknowledges the possibility of trying to teach these
        individuals, he also recognizes that it might not always be an option.
        The Stoic philosophy encourages acceptance of the uncontrollable aspects
        of life, including encounters with individuals deemed immoral or wicked.
        Marcus urges self-reflection and refraining from judgment, emphasizing
        that everyone, including himself, has faults.
